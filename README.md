# Email Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying emails into various categories by leveraging the power of transformer models. Specifically, the project employs two widely-used transformer models: BERT and DistilBERT. These models have been pre-trained on vast amounts of textual data and can be fine-tuned to accurately categorize emails. The use of these cutting-edge models enables high precision and efficiency in email classification.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- tensorflow 
- tensorflow_hub 
- tensorflow_text 
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 
- transformers

## Transformers Used

This project uses two transformer models: BERT and DistilBERT. These models have been pre-trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned to accurately classify emails into their respective categories.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the email classification model is evaluated using several metrics, including confusion matrix, F1 score, recall, kappa score, precision, and ROC curve. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in classifying emails.
